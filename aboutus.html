  <h2> About Us</h2>
  <br>
Despite food's central role in every person's livelihood, traditional urban models have left food access initiatives to outside organizations, such as food policy councils, nonprofit organizations, or as a shared priority across city departments. Food insecurity is an urban issue driven by the local economy, local service providers, the urban environment, and the quality of neighborhoods. The primary failures in previous initiatives stemmed from a lack of city institutions to champion and execute Private-Public Partnerships, such as with the previous New Orleans: Fresh Food Retailers Initiative. It is an essential first step to establish internal champions and leaders in our efforts to combat food insecurity and we suggest doing so by establishing an Office of Food Justice (OFJ) within our Office of Community Assets and Investments. Currently nonexistent in most US municipalities, a dedicated Office of Food Justice can parallel other city offices dedicated to access issues such as housing, transportation, and health.
