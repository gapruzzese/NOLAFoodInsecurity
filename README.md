# NOLA Food Insecurity

I have built a web application which connects the citizens of the City of New Orleans
with the new hypothetical Office of Food Justice, in order to aid the city in eliminating it’s stark
history with food insecurity. By providing the population this resource, it creates a hub for
information regarding the problem of food insecurity, while informing them about the steps the
city is taking to tackle the issue. In addition, it provides citizens with an interactive google map
of local grocery stores which comply with SNAP benefits as well as the new hypothetical Staple
Food Ordinance, which dictates the local grocery stores that retail a legislatively decided
amount of certain healthy food groups.

In updating this website, the city will hopefully be able to communicate their future
efforts to its constituents to maximize the impact of their actions. In the past, most US
municipalities fail to have an internal champion oriented around solving food insecurity, in the
way a Department of Housing would be a designated group working towards solving a housing
crisis. While the creation of the Office of Food Justice itself would be leaps and bounds ahead of
the current administrative efforts, the creation of this website heightens the efficacy of the
Office by establishing a direct hub of interaction with the community. Since food insecurity
cannot be solved without community outreach, this website is imperative to the new Offices
success.

On the website, the community members will have the opportunity to sign up and join
an email list. This will allow the community to be constantly updated on the City’s novel
attempts to solve this food injustice. Additionally, the Office of Food Justice can host a multitude
of events with which the citizens can engage. Information about these events and a function to
sign up for them will be included on the webpage to help the community to learn about the
benefits of healthy eating and efficient spending on healthy foods. Through all these efforts, the
website will play an important role in eliminating food insecurity in New Orleans.
