   <h1> What is Food Insecutity? </h1>
<Br>
  <p class="text-left">One of the most pressing issues facing New Orleans and its residents is the escalating rate of food insecurity. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food security as <q>access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.</q> Traditionally food insecurity has been assessed through the geographic framework of food deserts, denoted by the USDA as low-income areas with limited access to food. In 2022, New Orleans was ranked second among US cities for the highest rate of food insecurity. Below is a map of the city's census tracts which have less than 100 private vehicles and are 0.5 miles from the closest grocery store. </p> <br>

  <br>
      <div class="well well-sm">  <h3> What Creates Food Insecurity? </h3> 
   </div>


<br>
<p class="bg-info">The primary factors contributing to food insecurity are poverty and geographic access. </p> 
  <p class="text-left">New Orleans is particularly susceptible to the impacts of outside events, such as COVID-19 and Hurricane Katrina, because of the vulnerabilities in its physical infrastructure, lack of economic resilience, and systemic inequalities. New Orleans struggles with one of the highest poverty rates among major metropolitan areas in the US, with approximately 24% of its residents falling below the poverty line. Below is a map of Cenesus tracts indicating poverty levels in New Orleans, with darker areas experiencing higher incidence of poverty. (Notice the similarities to the maps above) Close to two-thirds of New Orleans&apos;s current population is African American, and their communities are three times more likely than their white counterparts to be unemployed and impoverished. </p> <br><br>

  <br>
      <div class="well well-sm"><h3> Why is Food Security Important? </h3>
   </div>

<br>


<p class="bg-info">Food insecurity has significant impacts on health, education, crime, and other social and economic outcomes. </p>
  <p class="text-left">For example, with each percentage point increase in food insecurity, violent crime increases at a rate of approximately 12%. New Orleans is the sixth most dangerous city in the US with a crime rate 150% higher than the national average. Studies from the American Heart Association highlight high prevalence of heart disease among people living in food deserts. Finally, data shows that children in food-insecure homes show smaller gains in both reading and math than food-secure classmates.  </p>
  <br><br>

      <div class="well well-sm"><h3> Previous Action in the City </h3>
   </div>

   <br>

<p class="bg-info">The most recent attempt to address food insecurity, started by former Mayor Landrieu, was The Fresh Food Retailer Initiative (FFRI). </p> 
  <p class="text-left">Striving to expand local grocer growth through investing $14 million worth of federal Community Development Block Grants, businesses were offered money to open grocery stores in underserved areas. FFRI ultimately failed due to <q>constant turnover of city staff, a skeptical state bureaucracy, and the many competing priorities in city government New Orleans.</q> No substantial government policy has taken its place, and the city has had to rely on nonprofits to aid citizens, such as Culture Aid and Top Box Foods. While a handful of smaller city initiatives, including the Healthy Corner Store Collaborative, have helped maximize local business sustainability and increased the availability of fresh food, comprehensive community-centered action should still be a priority. </p> <br><br>

    <div class="well well-sm"><h3> Why Now? </h3>
   </div>

<br>
<p class="bg-info">Food deserts remain a pervasive problem in New Orleans, and recent events have exacerbated the necessity for immediate action. </p> 
  <p class="text-left">When COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in March 2020, families who relied on the USDA SNAP benefits program received supplemental sums of at least $95 each month to be used on groceries. However, as of March 2023, all additional stipends have terminated as the Louisiana post-COVID Sustained Recovery Order ended. Combined with the everlasting rising inflation rates from the pandemic, families are scrambling to find more affordable options in a discouraging market.  <br><br>


Below is a map of the existing grocery stores in the city. &nbsp; An interctive map is available on the solutions tab. </p> <br><br>
