<h1> What We Doing To Help!</h1>
<br> 

  <p class="text-left">Rather than replicating the failures of FFRI and coaxing large-scale food retailers into food deserts, we advocated for a more pragmatic approach by incentivizing current retailers to broaden their offerings to include more fresh and affordable food choices. To kick off this initiative, we proposed and passed a Staple Food Ordinance which requires all food retailers to carry a specified quantity and variety of staple fresh foods.</p><br><br>

   <div class="well well-sm"><h3> Comparative Success in Minneapolis </h3>
   </div>

   <br>
  <p class="text-left">The foundation for this initiative mirrors a successful model in Minneapolis, MN. First passed in 2008, the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance seeks to <q>ensure that grocery stores in the City of Minneapolis provide a certain minimum level of healthy food.</q> A 2014 amendment strengthened the ordinance, closing loopholes and categorically defining the required foods. The ordinance requires various options within six major categories: Dairy/Dairy Alternatives, Animal and Vegetable Proteins, Fruits and Vegetables, Juice, Whole Grains, and Legumes. The ordinance has successfully improved fresh and healthy food options in retailers throughout the city and achieved a remarkable 65% compliance rate among retailers just two years after the revision. </p>
  <br><br>

   <div class="well well-sm"><h3> Why This Helps You! </h3>
   </div>
   <br>
  <p class="text-left">The city has tailored frameworks to the unique environment and culture of New Orleans. We have created an interactive Google Map feature, embedded below, to help you find the grocery stores which comply with our new Staple Food Ordinance (meaning they are SNAP eligible grocers)! This will ensure that the retailers you visit have the healthy, affordable food you need. </p>
